# codingDimension

I will put a lot of interesting personal project here, they will be maintained using the [codingDimensionTemplate](https://github.com/xzhuah/codingDimensionTemplate)(upgraded to [codingDimensionTemplate_Guice](https://github.com/xzhuah/codingDimensionTemplate_Guice) later), if you are interested in the template, please refer to that [repository](https://github.com/xzhuah/codingDimensionTemplate).

I plan to create a video to demo what are those great things in this project, but I just don't have time. I will just summarize them a little bit here

* A common libaray provides some highly reusable functions
* A framework for mongodb IO, I used mongodb for most of the projects currently
* A Crawler framework, easy to use, can easily be adopted to do any kind of crawler tasks. Future is used
* A WordCloud generator, supper easy to use, support English and Chinese, can draw personalized wordCloud easily
* A Crawler program which can fetch those most popular videos information on bilibili, I will add some analyze logic in the future
* A crawler program which can help you collect stock informatio, I will add some stock analyze logic in the future

One amazing thing about this is: under the organization of codingDimensionTemplate, Every part of the coding is modulized and connected. You can use easily access and adopt the functionality of other modulas from one modulas. Which greatly improved the code reusability.

Things are under active development, a lot of thinsg will come in the future. The framework and template may also be improved. I won't formally release this project and template in short term. This would be a long term project.
